## Usage
WARNING: Please, be aware that this program will change your game files, make a backup of them or do a file verification on Steam to get back to normal.

Select the game folder, extract some Patch MVGL files, you'll need them.

MVGL Files contents:


App_0.dx11.mvgl = Almost everything, from Lua code files to 3D models, textures and so on.

App_[Number] = [Language] version of some files, textures and so on.

App_Text0[Number] = [Language] text files.

App_romA_[Something] = Shouldn't matter for modding whatsoever.

App_Steam_[Something] = PC version of some files, mostly images, shaders and texts.




0 = Japanese

1 = English

2 = Simplified Chinese

3 = Traditional Chinese



Every (or almost) file have "Patch" equivalents, we'll be editing these files because they're smaller and will apply the mods anyway.

About audios and videos:

app_[Language]_sound.dx11.cpk

app_[Language]_movie.dx11.cpk


This program do NOT support repacking audios and videos. Maybe on the future.
